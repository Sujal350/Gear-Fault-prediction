# Gear Fault Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements multiple machine learning and deep learning techniques to **predict mechanical gear faults from vibration data**. The goal is to develop an accurate and automated system to classify gear conditions and detect anomalies that may indicate impending failures.

## Overview

The workflow includes:

**Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
- Loading vibration sensor datasets
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, filtering noise)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations

**Feature Engineering**
- Transforming raw signals into statistical and frequency-domain features

**Modeling**
- **H2O AutoML** to automatically train and tune multiple models (GBM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Deep Learning)
- **Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM)** for interpretable tree-based modeling
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to capture temporal patterns in vibration signals

**Evaluation**
- Cross-validation for robust performance assessment
- Accuracy metrics (achieving ~80%)
- Confusion matrix analysis to identify misclassification patterns

**Visualization**
- Model performance comparison charts
